# GhostMaze
Ghost Maze - a small maze RPG


The Ghost Maze of the Forsaken King
Welcome, Brave Adventurer!

The air is thick with the scent of forgotten stone and ancient dust. You awaken in a dark, labyrinthine dungeon, with no memory of how you arrived. All that remains is the echoing call of a long-lost tale...

Legend speaks of the Forsaken King, who sealed away the kingdom's most powerful artifacts in a series of cursed, ever-shifting mazes to protect them from a rising evil. But the King's spirit grew corrupted, and now his ghostly minions guard the artifacts, testing the mettle of any hero who dares to enter.

Are you the one prophesied to retrieve the artifacts and save the realm? Or will you, like so many before you, become just another ghost in the maze?

Prepare your wits and ready your courage!
